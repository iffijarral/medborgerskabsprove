            <p>It can take up to 3-4 weeks before the result of the exam is available. The authorities will then issue a certificate to you if you have passed the exam.</p>

            <h2>Appeals</h2>
            <p>You have the opportunity to complain about conditions during the exam. Such a complaint must be submitted to the International Recruitment and Integration Board (SIRI) no later than 4 weeks after the exam has taken place.</p>
